- Procedure
  - Include pictures of the lab set-up with proper labels
  - A detailed step-by-step procedure of your experiments, must include all of the materials listed.
- Data
  - Include tables of all of your raw data, graphs
- Results
  - Modified data used for analysis in tables, graphs.
- Analysis
  - Analysis must include how you used the data to calculate more useful information, including calculations.
  - Error analysis may be included.
- Discussion
  - Talk about your thoughts in detail the reasoning of your conclusion
- Conclusion
  - Final remarks, summary.

## Results
We found out that the energy lost in an inelastic collision is given by the formula

$$\Delta E = \frac{m_Am_B(v_A - v_B)^2}{2(m_A + m_B)},$$

where $m_A$ and $m_B$ are the masses of the two colliding objects and $v_A$ and $v_B$ are their initial velocities, respectively.
